# TV Show settings
# ----------------------
# Add custom sections to settings for your different shows. You can use the [defaults] section to define default 
# settings that apply to all shows.
# 
# Valid show settings are as follows:
#
# name:               The name of the show as it is found in tvdb. Defaults to the section name.
# 
# feed_name:          The name of the show to use for the ezrss feed search. Sometimes this can be different from the
#                     tvdb name, for example, "Agents of SHIELD" will be found in tvdb, however the ezrss name must be
#                     specified as "Marvels Agents of S H I E L D". This defaults to the configured "name" setting.
# 
# destination         Specify where to save the file once downloading has finished. This setting is required. Specify a
#                     full path, including the file name, but not the extension (extension will be automatically added).
#                     Any misssing directories in this path will be created upon download. This setting follows python
#                     string format rules. You will need to use format keys to specify how the file should be saved.
#                     For example, the following setting: "/videos/%(show_name)s/%(season)s-%(episode)s" would result in
#                     a file being saved as: /videos/My Show/5-3.avi (the file extension is automatically added).  
# 
#                     Valid format keys are:
# 
#                     %(show_name)s - the name of the show as specified in the "name" setting.  %(season)s - the season
#                     number of the episode.  %(episode)s - the episode number %(title)s - the title of the episode
# 
#                     See http://docs.python.org/library/stdtypes.html#string-formatting for more details on string
#                     formatting.
# 
# quality:            The "quality" of a show when searching. Examples are: HDTV, DSR, 720p, etc. Default is "HDTV".
# 
# seed_ratio:         When the torrent finishes downloading, it will continue seeding for other downloaders. Bittorrent
#                     etiquitte dictates that you seed at least 100%. After seeding is complete, the torrent will be
#                     removed and any remaining files that have not been relocated will be deleted. The default for this
#                     setting is 1 (100%).
# 
# start_season:       Prevent episodes from older seasons from being downloaded. Only episodes on or following the
#                     specified season will be downloaded.
#             
# start_episode:      Prevent older episodes from being downloaded. Only episodes on or following the specified one will
#                     be downloaded.
# 
# exclude_extensions: Comma-separated list of extensions (without the ".") to skip when searching for torrents. Torrents
#                     with files matching these extensions will not be selected for download.
# 
# max_concurrent:     Maximum number concurrent torrents to download (not including seeding). The default setting is 2
#                     concurrent downloads.
